<p>A CPU emulator written in C++. The instruction set is lightly inspired by x86 and the "Exploitation and Enumeration - Hard" challenge in NCL Fall 2024.</p>

Design Goal:
<uL>
  <li>Stack operations</li>
  <li>Basic arithmetics</li>
  <li>Basic CPU operations</li>
  <li>Privilege Levels</li>
  <li>Physic Memory Protection(PMP)</li>
</uL>

<p>An assembler is for this CPU is avaliable here.</p>
